# Claude Code Context

## Project Overview

This repository provides **four distinct Bayesian optimization methods** for resolving contact convergence failures in finite element simulations using the LLNL Tribol contact library and Smith/Serac solver framework.

The Smith SDK is pulled in as a git submodule in ./smith.

The ./methods directory includes four independent ML methods for resolving contact convergence issues.

The ./smith-models directory includes contact ememplar problems defined using the Smith SDK.

The ./references directory contains PDFs that were used to construct the Smith models.
